### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm MÃ¼jde, a passionate and aspiring FrontEnd Developer based in Antalya, Turkey. I'm always eager to stay ahead of the curve and embrace new technologies.

As a dedicated learner, I continuously seek opportunities to improve my skills and knowledge in Full Stack Development. My journey began with mastering the fundamentals of programming languages like HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, which laid the groundwork for my growth. 
I've mostly participated projects with using React JS Framework to create engaging and interactive user interfaces.

On the back-end, I've had experiences with Node.js and Next JS. Building projects from scratch has been an essential part of my learning journey, allowing me to apply my knowledge practically.

As I embrace every challenge with enthusiasm, I firmly believe in the power of continuous improvement. I am excited to connect with like-minded professionals, collaborate on innovative projects, and explore opportunities to grow to be a Full Stack Developer.

Let's connect and collaborate together!
